Possibly for seminar.

- Purpose
- MFA
- SFA
- MIPS
- Circularity metrics

### Purpose of indicators.
- Guide decision makers into making better choices for the environment. Decision-makers can be politicians (incentive-setting).
  - Different actors.
    - Politicians.
    - Public procurers - choose which company's get support from public sectors.
    - Companies.
  - Actual _versus_ potential.
    - Assess actual impact by looking at an entity today and seeing what is happening.
    - Potential impact is an educated guess about the future.
- Indicate environmental impact.
  - Economic indicators are not meant to correlate well with environmental impact methods. Rather, they're there to understand flows of money.
- Simple? Personal reflection: many indicators are somewhat simpler than a whole life cycle assessment.

### Material flow accounting

Different levels: nation-wide, sector-wide.
Choose material: wood, aluminium.
Pick a system boundary. Most often, production and extraction are included. Also, retail. Complex based on import and export.
Usually MFA looks at weight of the flow in a specified time-period.

- Time-period.
- Cradle-to-gate.
- Goal: resource efficiency.

### Substance flow analysis

Focus on a specific compound means SFA aims to understand the impact on a specific category, such as climate change or acidification.
Disadvantage: disregards other impact categories once you've chosen the one you're focussing on.
Choose system boundary and time-period.

- Time-period.
- Specific compounds.

### Material input per service

Shift focus from production to include consumption.

- Impact per function.
- Simiilar to MFA (uses weight).
- Shifted focus.

### Circularity metrics

Many indicators look at resources, assess circulation of materials.
We have to do three things:
- narrow the flows, reduce consumption (MIPS);      |reduce|
- slowing flows, increase life cycle of products;   |reuse|
- recirculation.                                    |recycle|

Some indicators look at input, some output, some both.

- Linearity of flows, similar to MFA.
- Many different metrics.
- Differ in what they capture.
