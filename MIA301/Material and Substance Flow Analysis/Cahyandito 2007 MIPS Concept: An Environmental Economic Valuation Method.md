#### Abstract
Sustainable development which is based on the economic, environmental and social dimension has been a never-ending theme. One requirement to reach a corporate sustainable management is first by establishing a sound environmental management.

The MIPS Concept that was developed by professor Schmidt-Bleek and the Wuppertal Institute Germany in 1993 is very useful to measure the environmental performance from a business activity. Using this concept, one may analyse the entire working process including all inserted natural resources (material and energy) in the process to produce a desired product or service, which then can be used as the basis to set up the Life Cycle Analysis.

This concept invites engineers in a company to to plan and design an environmental friendly process and also motivates them to make use of natural resources as wisely as possble. With this paper, the author will try to introduce the MIPS Concept and describe how the MIPS Concept can be applied to measure the environmental stress in a cradle-to-grave process.

#### Keywords
- MIPS
- ecological rucksack
- dematerialisation
- factor 10
- resource productivity
- eco-efficiency

#### First two sentences of the introduction
According to Dunphy _et al_[^1], sustainability is defined as "living and working in ways that meet and balance existing economic, environmental and social needs without compromising the wellbeing of future generations"[^2]. Based on the orientation to achieve sustainability, companies are required to make decisions and carry out programmes and projects in a manner that maintains or enhances financial viability while maximising benefits to the natural environment and humans and their cultures and communities[^2].

#### Last two sentences of the introduction
Therefore, to improve their environmental performance, businesses need to measure and monitor their product life cycle[^3]. A global framework for such environmental performance measurement, monitoring and reporting system is already emerging. One of them is the MIPS Concept (Material Input per Unit of Service).

## Procedure

## Summary of key points
Fundamental ecological information is ultimately important to the whole management system of the company and for innovation management. The decision-makers of a company must have total knowledge about:
- the ecological rucksack of relevant materials,
- the company's material and energy flows of a product life cycle,
- ecological-economical trade possibilities.

By conducting the material intensity analysis with the MIPS Concept, the company can explicittly have a better understanding of those items avove. Information obtained from MIPS measurement is a valuable instrument to prove that the company is such a responsible organisation; distributing information of what has been done (process, materials and energy) in producing its products through the Social and Environmental Report or even Sustainability Report [18].

In this view, the company also fulfils its Corporate Citizenship's obligation. MIPS, therefore, gives contribution to the company to be transparent and accountable vis-Ã -vis the company's stakeholders. It enables customers to compare which product or production process is more ecological than the other. 

Conducting MIPS to analyse the environmental performance of the company brings not only positive effect for the customer, but also to the company itself against the authority agency (to maintain the license to operate), against the NGO and the media (gaining or protecting good image), and against the employees and community (as a proof of sound environmental practice) [19].
