#### Abstract
Implementing circular economy (CE) principles is increasingly recommended as a convenient solution to meet the goals of sustainable development. New tools are required to support practitioners, decision-makers and policy-makers towards more CE practices, as well as to monitor the effects of CE adoption. Worldwide, academics, industrialists and politicians all agree on the need to use CE-related measuring instruments to manage this transition at different systemic levels. 

In this context, a wide range of circularity indicators (C-indicators) has been developed in recent years. Yet, as there is not one single definition of the CE concept, it is of the utmost importance to know what the available indicators measure in order to use them properly. Indeed, through a systematic literature review – considering both academic and grey literature – 55 sets of C-indicators, developed by scholars, consulting companies and governmental agencies, have been identified, encompassing different purposes, scopes, and potential usages. Inspired by existing taxonomies of eco-design tools and sustainability indicators, and in line with the CE characteristics, a classification of indicators aiming to assess, improve, monitor and communicate on the CE performance is proposed and discussed. 

In the developed taxonomy including 10 categories, C-indicators are differentiated regarding criteria such as the levels of CE implementation (_e.g._ micro, meso, macro), the CE loops (maintain, reuse, remanufacture, recycle), the performance (intrinsic, impacts), the perspective of circularity (actual, potential) they are taking into account, or their degree of transversality (generic, sector-specific). In addition, the database inventorying the 55 sets of C-indicators is linked to an Excel-based query tool to facilitate the selection of appropriate indicators according to the specific user’s needs and requirements. 

This study enriches the literature by giving a first need-driven taxonomy of C-indicators, which is experienced on several use cases. It provides a synthesis and clarification to the emerging and must-needed research theme of C-indicators, and sheds some light on remaining key challenges like their effective uptake by industry. Eventually, limitations, improvement areas, as well as implications of the proposed taxonomy are intently addressed to guide future research on C-indicators and CE implementation.

#### Highlights
- There is a growing need to monitor the circular economy transition and to measure its effects.
- 55 sets of circularity indicators (C-indicators) are reviewed and classified.
- A need-driven taxonomy is proposed to clarify their purposes and possible usages.
- An associated selection tool is provided to facilitate the identification of suitable C-indicators.
- The uptake of C-indicators by the industry and other promising challenges are discussed.

#### First two sentences of the introduction
In 1987, the Brundtland Commission called for the creation of new ways to assess progress toward sustainable development (SD), resulting in the emergence of a wide variety of sustainable development indicators (SDI) advanced by academics, companies, environmental agencies and governmental organisations[^1][^2]. Now, the adoption of circular economy (CE) practices appears as a timely, relevant and practical option to meet the goals of SD.

#### Last two sentences of the introduction
This actual challenge is in agreement with [^3] underlining the multitude of existing indicators can create confusion, or by [^4] advancing the measurement of circularity is considered to play a crucial role in the transition, but there is no prevailing opinion on which operationalisation to use. We do understand that finding suitable indicators can be a difficult task in the light of this important number of available C-indicators, but we argue it could be facilitated by the design of an appropriate classification scheme and associated selection tool.

# Article content
## Main concepts
#### Circular economy
An economic system that replaces the ‘end-of-life’ concept with reducing, alternatively reusing, recycling and recovering materials in production/distribution and consumption processes. It operates at the micro level (products, companies, consumers), meso level (eco-industrial parks) and macro level (city, region, nation and beyond), with the aim to accomplish sustainable development, thus simultaneously creating environmental quality, economic prosperity and social equity, to the benefit of current and future generations[^5][^6].

Additionally, according to the EMF (2013), the CE is based on three shared principles, which can be summarised as it follows: 
1. design out waste and pollution, 
2. keep products and materials in use, and 
3. regenerate natural systems[^7].

#### Indicator
This article adopts the global view of the OECD (2014) where an indicator is defined as "a quantitative or qualitative factor or variable that provides a simple and reliable means to measure achievement, to reflect changes connected to an intervention, or to help assess the performance of a development actor”[^8]. 

An indicator framework entails a collection of indicators that “conveys a broader purpose and significance to the individual indicator and provides a comprehensive picture of some entity”[^9]. Therefore, indicators simplify information, can help to reveal complex phenomena, and provide an effective tool for measuring progress and performance. 

## Supporting concepts
#### Typology
Study or system of sorting a large group into smaller groups according to similar features or qualities[^10]. Typology creates useful heuristics and provides a systematic basis for comparison[^11].

#### Taxonomy
Related to an empirical scheme of classification, suitable for descriptive analysis[^12]. In the scientific literature related to sustainability indicators, eco-design tools or even circular economy business model, the term “taxonomy” is mainly used when it comes to the classification of such indicators, tools or business models[^11].

## Research aim(s)
## Justification
CE definitions have been comprehensively reviewed by scholars. Sacchi _et al_. (2018) pointed out the lack of consensus on terminologies and definitions for the CE among scholars, politicians and practitioners investigating the trends, gaps, and convergence of the CE literature – through a sample composed of 327 academic articles[^5]. Similarly, Kirchherr et al. (2017) reviewed 114 circular economy definitions which were coded on 17 dimensions[^6]. 

## Methodology
Systematic review of 55 sets of circularity indicators.

Here, for the sake of completeness in the identification and screening of C-indicators, the research process includes:
- Combinations of following terms: ‘circular economy’, ‘circularity’, ‘evaluation’, ‘assessment’ ‘measure’, ‘indicators’, ‘indices’, ‘index’, and ‘metrics’ for the database search in title, abstract and keywords fields.
- Academic and non-academic databases: the review was based on both peer-reviewed journals articles or conferences papers and on grey literature. Indeed, in addition to academic literature, complementary sources (e.g. reports, policy communications) were consulted to widely cover the existing knowledge on C-indicators. As such, articles and C-indicators included in this study that are not necessary peer-reviewed – but will be indicated as such, for transparency, in the taxonomy.

Note that this study is limited to C-indicators and related publications in English, and the age of materials reviewed (time coverage) is from the emergence of C-indicators, _i.e._ 2010 to the submitted date of this research, _viz_. May 2018.

The analysis found 55 sets of C-indicators, coming from 27 journal articles, 2 conference papers, 1 master thesis, 7 technical reports, and 12 websites, tools (n.b. some publications include more than one set of C-indicators). Although the research period starts in 2000, the first specific publication on C-indicators found was from 2010.
