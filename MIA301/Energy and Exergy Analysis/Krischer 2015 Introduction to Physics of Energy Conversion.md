- What is energy?
  - Fundamentally, energy is something that can be stored within systems in various forms and can be converted from one form to the other.
  - However, providing energy sustainably means ”energy needs of the present are met without restricting the ability of future generations to satisfy their needs” [^1], under three conditions:
    - they should not be consumed,
    - they should not lead to emissions of environmental pollutants,
    - they should not lead to negative impacts on health and social justice.
  - Most of the energy sources today voilate all three conditions – fossil based.
  - Today most of the sustainable energy sources violate at least one of the three conditions.
- Energy analysis.
  - Energy analysis is based on the first law of thermodynamics and its statement of energy conservation.
  - Primary energy – energy in its natural form that hasn’t undergone any transformational processes.
  - Final energy – energy available at the point of use after undergoing one or many transformation processes.
  - Useful or net energy – energy available in the form of final application for end-use.

  - Indicators:
    - energy intensity,
    - energy efficiency,
    - emissions intensity of energy.
- Exergy/availability.
  - While quantities of energy allow for bookkeeping – based on the first law of thermodynamics, exergy involves the quality of energy and its degradation during energy conversion.
  - Exergy analysis is based on the second law of thermodynamics.
  - Exergy is a property that enables us to determine the useful work potential of a given amount of energy at a given state (dead state).

- Irreversibility.
  - Irreversibility is the difference between reversible work and useful work.
    - _I_ = _W_<sub>r</sub> - _W_<sub>u</sub>
      - _I_: irreversibility
      - _W_<sub>r</sub>: reversible work
      - _W_<sub>u</sub>: useful work
  - Reversible work is the maximum useful work that can be produced (or the minimum work consumed) as a system undergoes a process between the specified initial and final states.
  - Difference between actual work and surround work is useful work.
    - _W_<sub>u</sub> = _W_ - _W_<sub>s</sub>
      - _W_: actual work
      - _W_<sub>s</sub>: reversible work
      - _W_<sub>u</sub>: useful work

  - When _a_ expands inside a cylinder to push a piston, it has to work against the atmospheric pressure _P_<sub>0</sub>. This work is irreversible and cannot be recovered and utilised and it called surrounding work.
    - _W_<sub>surroundings</sub> = _P_<sub>0</sub>(_V_<sub>2</sub> - _V_<sub>1</sub>).
      - _W_<sub>surroundings</sub>: surrounding work
      - _P_<sub>0</sub>: pressure of the surroundings
      - _V_<sub>2</sub> - _V_<sub>1</sub>: volume change of the system
- Exergy.
  - Exergy associated with kinetic energy.
    - Kinetic energy can be converted to work entirely regardless of its surrounding – exergy of kinetic energy equals the kinetic energy itself.
  - Exergy associated with potential energy.
    - Similarly potential energy can also be converted to work entirely regardless of its surrounding – which equals to kinetic energy itself.
  - Exergy associated with internal energy.
    - In a stationary compressible system at dead state (P0, T0), there is only internal energy.
    - When it undergoes a reversible process from initial state (P,T) to dead state (P0, T0) the useful work delivered during this process is the exergy of the system at its initial state, which equals the exergy of the internal energy of the system.
  - Example:
    - what is the available power at a wind turbine with a rotor radius of five metres, if the average wind velocity at STC is 25 m/s?
    - a perfect wind turbine will bring the air to a dead state (complete stop) by capturing all the energy in the air
    - kinetic energy equals exergy
      - _x_ = _v_<sup>2</sup> * 0.5 = 312 * 5 Joules per kilogramme
    - quantity of air passing through the rotor over time
      - _m_ = ρ_Av_ = ρ * (π_r_<sup>2</sup> * 0.5) * _v_
        - _m_ = 1 * 18 * 0.5(3 * 14 (5)<sup>2</sup>) * 25 = 1157 * 8 kilogrammes per second
    - available power
      - _w_ = _xm_ = 312 * 5(1157 * 8) = 361 kiloWatt
