# General
#### Author(s)

#### First two sentences of the introduction
The environmental challenge of turning the consumer society in a more sustainable direction is tremendous. In this context, life cycle assessment (LCA) has been brought forward as an important and comprehensive method for analysis of the environmental impact of products and services.

#### Last two sentences of the introduction
In the impact assessment phase, the emissions and resources are related to various environmental problems through the act of classification and characterisation. Finally, the different environmental impacts related to the life cycle may be put on the same scale through weighting.

- Life Cycle Assessment is mainly connected to Sustainable Development Goal 13 _climate action_ and №17 _life on land_.
- Life cycle assessment can help you make the choice between a paper, plastic or porcelain coffee cup.
- History of the life cycle assessment:
  - 1969 Coca-Cola study
    - conducted in the United States by the Midwest Research Institute from 1969 to 1970 is generally considered the first LCA study
  - 1973 oil crisis
    - energy systems studies became common after the oil crisis in 1973, LCA has its roots in energy analysis
  - 1980s packaging and solid waste
    - developed towards solid waste assessment
  - 1990s term "life cycle assessment" in use
    - it was not until the early 1990s that the term life cycle assessment came into general use—earlier studies were called eco-balances, resource and environmental profile analyses, or cradle- to-grave studies
  - 1993 first international guidelines
  - 1997 first ISO standards
  - 2006 current standard ISO 14040 and ISO 14044
  - methodology is continuously developing
    - more complexity analysing not only products but services and systems
- Life cycle assessment.
  - Based on environmental ideas:
    - long-term resource base,
    - health,
    - nature as such.
  - To go from idea to action, methods and tools are needed to analyse environmental impact from human activities.
  - LCA is one of the tools suitable for product-related issues.
  - Things not included in LCA (except possibly through weighting).
    - Geography (LCA is not place specific).
    - Economy (see life cycle costing, cost benefit analysis).
    - Social issues (see Social LCA).
    - Risk Assessment (see Environmental Risk Analysis).
  - Method for describing the total potential environmental impact of a product system.
    - LCA is an inventory of all resource use and emissions related to the life cycle of a product system, and an analysis of the potential environmental impact emerging from it.
- Weaknesses in life cycle assessment.
  - Complex.
    - Complex because it considers a comprehensive chain of processes - and is hence data intensive[^1].
  - Requires competence.
    - Demands competence to be able to ask the “right” questions and interpret the results, give recommendations.
  - Interpretation of results.
    - Transparency is central for a LCA study. Enable review.
  - Time and money.
    - To do an LCA takes time and that could be expensive, also experts could be expensive.
    - Requires expert knowledge[^1].
  - Data demanding.
    - Without data LCA cannot analyse anything. This could be from a database and/or collected primary data.
  - No "systems perspective".
    - Does not directly consider future changes in technology and demand[^1].
    - Does not consider rebound and other societal effects[^1].
    - Only known and quantifiable environmental impacts are considered[^1].
- Areas of use:
  - decision-making:
    - product and process design and development
    - procurement, purchase
    - regulations, policy instruments
  - learning:
    - about the product or service
    - identification of potential improvements
    - choice of indicators
  - market communication:
    - LCA-based environmental labelling
    - environmental footprint methods
    - environmental product declarations (EPD)
    - benchmarking
  - regulatory requirements:
    - a number of EU-directives are based on LCA
    - environmental product declaration
  - a base for improvement
  - comparison of alternatives
  - strategic planning
- LCA-system is a model.
  - All models are wrong, but some are useful [^2][^3].
  - LCA as a scientific model, it is a combination of a mathematical, a computational, and a statistical model. 
  - The LCA inventory list is converted into chosen impact indicators. 
  - Scientists in such fields as chemistry, meteorology, and ecology have developed model fragments to estimate _e.g_. the atmospheric lifetimes of greenhouse gases, their effect on the radiation balance and the formation of clouds, and the effects of temperature on the distribution of species[^4].
  - This means using mathematics, statistics, supercomputers, and additionally a panel of experts to produce the characterisation model that is used in LCA.
- Life cycle of a product or system.

    - Iterative means that the analyst moves back and forth in the process as the LCA study is done.
    - Goal and scope definition.
      - Context:
        - who - intended audience,
        - why - reason, intended application,
        - what - product/system.
      - Procedural aspects:
        - reporting and critical review,
        - what actors?
      - Modelling aspects:
        - purpose - specified question,
        - functional unit,
        - system boundaries and initial flow chart,
        - what impact categories?
      - This is a very important step since it will shape the result. Ask the question you want to answer and remember that you can only answer that question.
      - These steps are also useful to use when working with other methods.
      - In the beginning you have to make decision about things you might not know much about. After some work with the study, you know more and you might need to go back and change things in the goal and scope. Then the process is iterative.
      - Flow chart.
        - What processes are included in the system?
        - How are they connected?
        - No inputs and outputs in the initial flow chart.
      - Functional unit (FU).
        - Function in quantitative terms.
        - Reference flow.
        - Comparing alternatives.
        - Hard to quantify qualitative and subjective aspects (such as taste, beauty, quality).
        - Examples:
          - |product|function|functional unit|
            |-------|--------|---------------|
            |light bulb|lighting|lumen (amount of light)|
            |car|personal transport|passenger kilometer|
            |refrigerator|cooling and keeping things at cool temperatures|litre of cold volume (specified to 5°C for instance)|
            |bread|nutrition, energy|up for debate, commonly: loaf, or something related to weight|
            |house|dwelling space|bed space, house, square metreage|
      - System boundaries:
        - to natural systems,
        - geographical,
        - time perspective,
        - excluding insignificant processes,
        - to other products' life cycles (allocation).
        - Examples:
          - cradle-to-grave,
          - cradle-to-gate,
          - gate-to-gate,
          - gate-to-grave,
          - well-to-wheel,
          - well-to-vehicle.
        - Insignificant processes might be machinery life cycles used in a production process, the way an operator gets to work, and other things that will have an insignificant impact to the studied system/product.
      - Allocation.
        - Allocation means partitioning.
        - Hence, the question is how much of the process (multi in/output) do we put on the studied product?
        - It can be about deciding how much credit from the recycling is divided to the first and the second life cycle.
        - Allocation can be based on energy, value, mass and other aspects.
      - System expansion.
        - ![afbeelding](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78508062/150743482-dad194cf-f4b9-4c2d-beee-a707e2fc885e.png)
          - The question here is how to calculate the benefits of using the surplus heat.
          - The benefit is the "avoided burden" of having to use other means of producing heat.
    - Inventory analysis.
      - In the second process step where details are added to the flowchart.
      - Data on inputs and outputs are found and quantified:
        - energy, 
        - resources, 
        - emissions to air, soil, and water.
      - In/outputs recalculated to the functional unit.
      - Flow model.
        - Incomplete energy and mass balance.
          - Due to that only environmentally relevant flows are used (but most energy and mass are relevant).
        - Environmentally relevant flows.
        - Includes inputs and outputs.
    - Impact assessment.
      - The purpose of life cycle impact assessment is to provide additional information to help assess a product system’s inventory results to understand their environmental significance better. 
      - The impact assessment method transforms the long list of life cycle inventory results, into a limited number of indicator scores.
      - Choice of impact categories + classification.
        - Land and resource use, global warming, ozone depletion, acidification, eutrophication, photo-oxidant formation, human toxicity, _et cetera_.
      - Characterisation.
      - Weighting.
    - Interpretation.
