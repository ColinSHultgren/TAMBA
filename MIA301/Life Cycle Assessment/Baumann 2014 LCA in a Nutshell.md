# General
#### Author(s)

#### First two sentences of the introduction
The environmental challenge of turning the consumer society in a more sustainable direction is tremendous. In this context, life cycle assessment (LCA) has been brought forward as an important and comprehensive method for analysis of the environmental impact of products and services.

#### Last two sentences of the introduction
In the impact assessment phase, the emissions and resources are related to various environmental problems through the act of classification and characterisation. Finally, the different environmental impacts related to the life cycle may be put on the same scale through weighting.

- Life Cycle Assessment is mainly connected to Sustainable Development Goal 13 _climate action_ and №17 _life on land_.
- Life cycle assessment can help you make the choice between a paper, plastic or porcelain coffee cup.
- History of the life cycle assessment:
  - 1969 Coca-Cola study
    - conducted in the United States by the Midwest Research Institute from 1969 to 1970 is generally considered the first LCA study
  - 1973 oil crisis
    - energy systems studies became common after the oil crisis in 1973, LCA has its roots in energy analysis
  - 1980s packaging and solid waste
    - developed towards solid waste assessment
  - 1990s term "life cycle assessment" in use
    - it was not until the early 1990s that the term life cycle assessment came into general use—earlier studies were called eco-balances, resource and environmental profile analyses, or cradle- to-grave studies
  - 1993 first international guidelines
  - 1997 first ISO standards
  - 2006 current standard ISO 14040 and ISO 14044
  - methodology is continuously developing
    - more complexity analysing not only products but services and systems
- Life cycle assessment.
  - Based on environmental ideas:
    - long-term resource base,
    - health,
    - nature as such.
  - To go from idea to action, methods and tools are needed to analyse environmental impact from human activities.
  - LCA is one of the tools suitable for product-related issues.
  - Things not included in LCA (except possibly through weighting).
    - Geography (LCA is not place specific).
    - Economy (see life cycle costing, cost benefit analysis).
    - Social issues (see Social LCA).
    - Risk Assessment (see Environmental Risk Analysis).
  - Method for describing the total potential environmental impact of a product system.
    - LCA is an inventory of all resource use and emissions related to the life cycle of a product system, and an analysis of the potential environmental impact emerging from it.
- Weaknesses in life cycle assessment.
  - Complex.
    - Complex because it considers a comprehensive chain of processes - and is hence data intensive[^1].
  - Requires competence.
    - Demands competence to be able to ask the “right” questions and interpret the results, give recommendations.
  - Interpretation of results.
    - Transparency is central for a LCA study. Enable review.
  - Time and money.
    - To do an LCA takes time and that could be expensive, also experts could be expensive.
    - Requires expert knowledge[^1].
  - Data demanding.
    - Without data LCA cannot analyse anything. This could be from a database and/or collected primary data.
  - No "systems perspective".
    - Does not directly consider future changes in technology and demand[^1].
    - Does not consider rebound and other societal effects[^1].
    - Only known and quantifiable environmental impacts are considered[^1].
- Areas of use:
  - decision-making:
    - product and process design and development
    - procurement, purchase
    - regulations, policy instruments
  - learning:
    - about the product or service
    - identification of potential improvements
    - choice of indicators
  - market communication:
    - LCA-based environmental labelling
    - environmental footprint methods
    - environmental product declarations (EPD)
    - benchmarking
  - regulatory requirements:
    - a number of EU-directives are based on LCA
    - environmental product declaration
  - a base for improvement
  - comparison of alternatives
  - strategic planning
- LCA-system is a model.
  - All models are wrong, but some are useful [^2][^3].
  - LCA as a scientific model, it is a combination of a mathematical, a computational, and a statistical model. 
  - The LCA inventory list is converted into chosen impact indicators. 
  - Scientists in such fields as chemistry, meteorology, and ecology have developed model fragments to estimate _e.g_. the atmospheric lifetimes of greenhouse gases, their effect on the radiation balance and the formation of clouds, and the effects of temperature on the distribution of species[^4].
  - This means using mathematics, statistics, supercomputers, and additionally a panel of experts to produce the characterisation model that is used in LCA.
- Life cycle of a product or system.

- Process.

    - Iterative means that the analyst moves back and forth in the process as the LCA study is done.
    - Goal and scope definition.
      - Context:
        - who - intended audience,
        - why - reason, intended application,
        - what - product/system.
      - Procedural aspects:
        - reporting and critical review,
        - what actors?
      - Modelling aspects:
        - purpose - specified question,
        - functional unit,
        - system boundaries and initial flow chart,
        - what impact categories?
      - This is a very important step since it will shape the result. Ask the question you want to answer and remember that you can only answer that question.
      - These steps are also useful to use when working with other methods.
      - In the beginning you have to make decision about things you might not know much about. After some work with the study, you know more and you might need to go back and change things in the goal and scope. Then the process is iterative.
      - Flow chart.
        - What processes are included in the system?
        - How are they connected?
        - No inputs and outputs in the initial flow chart.
      - Functional unit (FU).
        - Function in quantitative terms.
        - Reference flow.
        - Comparing alternatives.
        - Hard to quantify qualitative and subjective aspects (such as taste, beauty, quality).
        - Examples:
          - |product|function|functional unit|
            |-------|--------|---------------|
            |light bulb|lighting|lumen (amount of light)|
            |car|personal transport|passenger kilometer|
            |refrigerator|cooling and keeping things at cool temperatures|litre of cold volume (specified to 5°C for instance)|
            |bread|nutrition, energy|up for debate, commonly: loaf, or something related to weight|
            |house|dwelling space|bed space, house, square metreage|
      - System boundaries:
        - to natural systems,
        - geographical,
        - time perspective,
        - excluding insignificant processes,
        - to other products' life cycles (allocation).
        - Examples:
          - cradle-to-grave,
          - cradle-to-gate,
          - gate-to-gate,
          - gate-to-grave,
          - well-to-wheel,
          - well-to-vehicle.
        - Insignificant processes might be machinery life cycles used in a production process, the way an operator gets to work, and other things that will have an insignificant impact to the studied system/product.
      - Allocation.
        - Allocation means partitioning.
        - Hence, the question is how much of the process (multi in/output) do we put on the studied product?
        - It can be about deciding how much credit from the recycling is divided to the first and the second life cycle.
        - Allocation can be based on energy, value, mass and other aspects.
      - System expansion.
        - ![afbeelding](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78508062/150743482-dad194cf-f4b9-4c2d-beee-a707e2fc885e.png)
          - The question here is how to calculate the benefits of using the surplus heat.
          - The benefit is the "avoided burden" of having to use other means of producing heat.
    - Inventory analysis.
      - In the second process step where details are added to the flowchart.
      - Data on inputs and outputs are found and quantified:
        - energy, 
        - resources, 
        - emissions to air, soil, and water.
      - In/outputs recalculated to the functional unit.
      - Flow model.
        - Incomplete energy and mass balance.
          - Due to that only environmentally relevant flows are used (but most energy and mass are relevant).
        - Environmentally relevant flows.
        - Includes inputs and outputs.
    - Impact assessment.
      - The purpose of life cycle impact assessment is to provide additional information to help assess a product system’s inventory results to understand their environmental significance better. 
      - The impact assessment method transforms the long list of life cycle inventory results, into a limited number of indicator scores.
      - Choice of impact categories + classification.
        - Land and resource use, global warming, ozone depletion, acidification, eutrophication, photo-oxidant formation, human toxicity, _et cetera_.
      - Characterisation.
      - Weighting.
        - Stepwise aggregation from inventory analysis to impact assessment.
          - ![afbeelding](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78508062/150857002-488a9a5c-0010-416b-8b67-2741c4477d9e.png)
          - The characterisation is based on scientific results concerning cause-effect.
          - Classification is the relative contributions to each impact category.
          - Impact assessment methods based on preferences and value judgements, _e.g._ what is critical to focus on or political environmental goals.
          - Example weighting methods: eco-indicator, EPS (willingsness to pay to avoid damanges_, environmental themes, EDIP.
      - Impact Assessment Method ReCIPe2016.
        - There are many different IA methods this is an example.
        - ReCiPe Impact assessment method.
        - The long inventory list is ”translated” to impact categories.
        - Midpoint and/or endpoint impacts can be used as results.
        - The analysis is determined by what cultural perspective is chosen.
        - Different cultural perspectives: 
          - individualist (weak sustainability), 
          - hierarchist (Consensus, used in research), 
          - egalitarian (strong sustainability).
        - Indicators:
          - midpoint,
          - endpoint.
        - The indicator scores on different levels contain factors according to the three cultural perspectives:
          - individualist: short term, optimism that technology can avoid many problems in future,
            - based on proven cause-effect impacts, a short time perspective, and technosolutionist,
          - hierarchist: consensus model, as often encountered in scientific models, this is often considered to be the default model, 
            - consensus model, as often encountered in scientific models; this is often considered to be the default model. It is usually defined using a time perspective of 100 years and is based on facts supported by several scientific and political bodies,
          - egalitarian: long term based on precautionary principle thinking
            - based on including almost all known or assumed effects, a long time perspective, and based on precautionary principle thinking.
        - Strong and weak sustainability.
          - ![afbeelding](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78508062/150859405-66c36967-8d91-4903-a43f-8042a514d005.png)
          - There is a connection between the three cultural perspectives and the concept of weak and strong sustainability. The individualist perspective and the weak sustainability share the goal to maximise each individual interest to add to the best possible sum for society as a whole, _i.e._ the freedom of enterprise and the compensation mechanisms between planet and prosperity, based on a misleading illusion of interchangeability[^5]. 
          - On the opposite value pole, the hierarchist and egalitarian perspective imply that not only the common interest be taken into account but also the interests of future generations and the natural world, corresponding to strong sustainability[^5].
      - Weighting.
        - Conversion of indicator results for various environmental impact categories using numerical factors.
        - Based on various value bases, not on natural science.
        - Recommended to use several different weighting methods in combination with a variation analysis.
        - Inventory results, characterisation results and weighting results need to be analysed together.
        - Weighting is a process of converting indicator results for different environmental impact categories through use of numerical factors based on valuation principles. It may include aggregation of the weighted indicator results.
        - Weighting is an optional element with two possible methods, either 
          - conversion of the indicator results or the normalised results with selected weighting factors, or 
          - aggregation of the transformed indicator results or the normalised results across environmental impact categories.
        - The weighting steps are based on values and are not scientifically based.
        - Various individuals, organisations and societies may have different preferences, so it is possible for different parties to weigh in different ways despite the same indicator result or normalised indicator result. 
        - In an LCA it may be desirable to use several different weighting factors and weighting methods, and performing a sensitivity analysis to assess the impact on the LCIA results for different values and weighting methods.
      - Recommended to use several different environmental impact categories.
      - Quality analysis and review.
      - Interpretation and presentation.
      - In this step it is clear that we have to have an iterative process.
      - Connections between impact assessment and interpretation.
    - Interpretation.
      - In the interpretation step the findings are combined consistent with the goal and scope to reach conclusion and recommendations.
      - What is of relevance?
      - What is “big” and what is “small”?
      - Why?
      - Can we answer the question defined in the goal and scope step?
      - The interpretation in an LCA or LCI study includes several parts:
        - identification of the significant issues based on the results from inventory analysis and environmental impact analysis,
        - evaluation to establish confidence in the results, _e.g._ through completeness check, sensitivity and consistency checks,
        - conclusions, limitations, recommendations, and 
        - reporting.
      - How robust are the results?
        - Completeness check - data gaps in inventory.
        - Consistency check – modelling an methodological choices.
        - Uncertainty analysis – effect of uncertainty.
        - Sensitivity analysis – Identification and check of effect of critical data.
        - Variation analysis – alternative scenarios, _e.g._ +/- 50%.
        - Data quality assessment – degree of data gaps, approximate data and appropriate data.
- Critical choices in LCA:
  - functional unit,
  - system boundaries and allocation,
  - type of data,
  - impact assessment method.
