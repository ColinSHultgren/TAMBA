#### First two sentences of the introduction
Sustainability has become a mantra for the 21st century. It embodies the promise of societal evolution towards a more equitable and wealthy world in which the natural environment and our cultural achievements are preserved for generations to come. 

#### Last two sentences of the introduction
Eco-efficiency is a valuable part of corporate strategies. However, as the sole concept it is insufficient[^1]. Schaltegger and Sturm[^2][^3][^4], who were among the first to use the term, had intended ecoefficiency as one corporate measure among several. As this paper will demonstrate, ecoefficiency is only one part of the corporate sustainability criteria.

# Article content
## Main concepts
#### Corporate sustainability
Meeting the needs of a firm’s direct and indirect stakeholders (such as shareholders, employees, clients, pressure groups, communities etc), without compromising its ability to meet the needs of future stakeholders as well.

## Supporting concepts
#### Natural capital
There are two main types of natural capital: It can firstly take the form of natural resources. These are consumed in many economic processes, and can either be renewable (_e.g._ wood, fish, corn) or non-renewable (fossil fuel, biodiversity, soil quality). On the other hand, natural capital takes the form of ecosystem services (_e.g._ climate stabilisation, water purification, soil remediation, reproduction of plants and animals).

Ecologically sustainable companies use only natural resources that are consumed at a rate below the natural reproduction, or at a rate below the development of substitutes. They do not cause emissions that accumulate in the environment at a rate beyond the capacity of the natural system to absorb and assimilate these emissions. Finally they do not engage in activity that degrades eco-system services.

#### Economic capital
economic sustainability requires firms to manage several types of economic capital: financial capital (_i.e._ equity, debt), tangible capital (_i.e._ machinery, land, stocks) and intangible capital (_i.e._ reputation, inventions, know-how, organisational routines).

Economically sustainable companies guarantee at any time cashflow sufficient to ensure liquidity while producing a persistent above average return to their shareholders.

#### Social capital
There are two different types of social capital: human capital and societal capital. Human capital concerns primarily aspects such as skills, motivation and loyalty of employees and business partners. Societal capital, on the other hand, includes the quality of public services, such as a good educational system, infrastructure or a culture supportive of entrepreneurship.

Socially sustainable companies add value to the communities within which they operate by increasing the human capital of individual partners as well as furthering the societal capital of these communities. They manage social capital in such a way that stakeholders can understand its motivations and can broadly agree with the company’s value system.

## Research aim(s)
The article is intended as a contribution to the ongoing conceptual development of corporate sustainability. At the business level sustainability is often equated with eco-efficiency. However, such a reduction misses several important criteria that firms have to satisfy if they want to become truly sustainable. 

This article discusses how the concept of sustainable development has evolved over the past three decades and particularly how it can be applied to the business level. It then goes on to describe the three types of capital relevant within the concept of corporate sustainability: economic, natural and social capital.

From this basis we shall then develop the six criteria managers aiming for corporate sustainability will have to satisfy: eco-efficiency, socio-efficiency, eco-effectiveness, socio-effectiveness, sufficiency and ecological equity.

## Summary of key points
- Although the debate about eco-efficiency is by far from over, we argue in this paper that issue of eco-effectiveness deserves equal scholarly attention.
- The relationship between business and social sustainability is receiving more attention as a research issue. However, the research to date has failed to provide a systematic framework for both socio-efficiency and socio-effectiveness.
- There is a critical need to develop business relevant criteria for such issues as ecological equity. Current research is largely focused on the role politics and individual consumers can play in the development of these criteria. We need to bring in the private sector as a stakeholder into this process.

# Context
Reaffirms the importance of the triple bottom line and argus for equal scholarly attention for eco-efficiency and eco-effectiveness. 

# Lecture comments
- Corporate sustainability.
  - The term Corporate Sustainability (CS) has emerged as an alternative to CSR, where CS is being considered to be a precondition for doing business, as a 'business case'[^5], and the desirable path for organisations[^6][^7].
  - CS has been proposed as a framework to address the full array of sustainability challenges and issues (see [^8][^9][^10]).
  - "_Meeting the needs of a firm's direct and indirect stakeholders (such as shareholders, employees, clients, pressure groups, communities etc.), without compromising its ability to meet the needs of future stakeholders as well_"[^5] (p. 131).
  - Based on the Brundtland definition.
  - Connected with the Business Case for Sustainability.
  - Vague.
  - For a company to become more sustainability orientated, it should make changes that include the introduction of resource-efficient technologies, sustainability reporting schemes, and the provision of sustainable products, services, and product-service combinations[^11].
  - CS should encompass a holistic perspective[^12][^13][^14].
  - "_Corporate activity that proactively seek to contribute to sustainability equilibria, including the economic, environmental and social dimension of today, as well as their interrelations within and throughout the time dimension (i.e. the short, long and longer term), while addressing the company's system_"[^15] (p.50).
  - Considering a holistic perspective of sustainability.
  - Including the company's system.
- Critiques of eco-efficiency.
  - Relativity, or rebound effect (Korhonen, 2003): improvements in efficiency that lead to increases in products or services, making the absolute impacts larger than previously[^5][^16].
  - A lack of focus on social dimension or confusing them with health and safety issues[^5][^17][^18].
  - Difficulty in measuring or proving the appropriate business case to quantify opportunities[^19][^20].
  - Affected by standard economic theory assuming limitless resources and availability[^17].
- Eco-effectiveness or eco-efficacy.
  - Alternative design and production concept to strategies of zero emissions and eco-efficiency.
  - Addresses the absolute positive environmental impact a firm could reasonably achieve[^5].
  - It addresses the entire system, _i.e._ it tries to make the entire system more efficient, and not just making a part more efficient (remember the elephant).
- Eco-efficiency.
  - eco-effiency equals the product or service value divided by the environmental influence
  - To improve both economic and ecological efficiency.
  - To improve more value with less environmental impact.
  - One of the concepts most widely accepted as the business link to sustainability[^5][^19].

# Questions
- What is the _business case for sustainability_?
  - how firms can further their economic sustainability by paying attention to social and environmental issues, _i.e._ increase their ecological and social efficiency. Although such an approach is an important step towards corporate sustainability, it is unfortunately not enough.
