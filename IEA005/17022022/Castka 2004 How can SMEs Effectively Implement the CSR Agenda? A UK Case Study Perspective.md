#### Abstract
This paper focuses on implementation of the CSR agenda in small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs) and reports on research findings from an action research case study that has been conducted in a UK based SME. The case study research demonstrates how the CSR agenda has been implemented using ISO 9001:2000 as a platform and what benefits the case study organization has gained from this approach. These results are compared with a UK survey on feasibility of CSR for SMEs conducted by the UK’s Department of Trade and Industry and parallels are drawn.

#### First two sentences of the introduction
Corporate social responsibility (CSR), corporate governance (CG), corporate citizenship and triple bottom line (TBL) became more or less synonyms for the emerging effort to determine the meaning of ‘ethical business’. In the broadest sense, all these agendas aim to translate the complexity and holism of business–society interface into organizational realities and operational settings[^1] (Lunheim, 2003). 

#### Last two sentences of the introduction
The case study research demonstrates how the CSR agenda has been implemented and what benefits the case study organisation has gained from this approach. These results are compared with a UK survey on feasibility of CSR for SMEs conducted by the UK’s Department of Trade and Industry[^2], and parallels are drawn.

# Article content
## Main concepts
#### Corporate Social Responsibility
The authors finally argue that CSR is a concept to run organisations profitably yet in a socially and environmentally responsible way in order to achieve business sustainability and stakeholder satisfaction. This definition is advocated for use in promoting the CSR agenda among SMEs.

## Research aim(s)
This paper attempts to face these challenges and reports on research findings from a case study action research that has been conducted in a UK based SME. The case study research demonstrates how the CSR agenda has been implemented and what benefits the case study organisation has gained from this approach. These results are compared with a UK survey on feasibility of CSR for SMEs conducted by the UK’s Department of Trade and Industry[^2], and parallels are drawn.
## Methodology
Building on the data gathered in [^2] to review the business case for SME-CSR, ethnographic research into OLC Europe. The researchers developed a collaborative problem-solving relationship between themselves and the client, which aimed at both solving the problem (_i.e._ implementation of the CSR agenda) and creating the knowledge (_i.e._ developing the theory around CSR implementation in an SME).

This type of research is not a panacea for research in organisations yet is appropriate and provides opportunities for theory development[^7]. Therefore, the output of this research cannot be considered as generalisable and the intention is, as [^8] puts it, to provide a theoretical vehicle for the examination of other cases.

## Results
- OLC adopted the approach suggested by [^9][^10][^11], _i.e._ finding the balance between entrepreneurship and ethical practice.
- Current business systems in operations should be used as a vehicle for CSR implementation.
- SMEs can fear the bureaucracy that CSR can bring.

## Summary of key points
This case study demonstrated that the CSR agenda can serve as a vehicle for business improvement and building of competitive advantage for SMEs. Practitioners are advised to build a business system that is based on key business processes that show
- creation of business objectives and targets in line with the CSR agenda,
- delivery of business objectives and targets within appropriate processes,
- measurement of business objectives, their comparison to targets and review of process effectiveness and efficiency, and
- improvement as a result of measurement and review.

To the academic community this research can provide a contextual background and theoretical vehicle for further research that can prove/disprove the generalizability of these findings.
