#### Abstract
Corporate sustainability has recently been challenging traditional business models that have been based on value proposition, creation and capture. There has been a steady increase in publications using the term “sustainable business models”; however, there have been few that have theoretically defined or characterized the term, and in most cases, they just apply the term. 

Seven peer‐reviewed papers were selected that aimed to define and explain sustainable business models and that have been widely cited. The papers were analyzed by assessing the elements and activities covered using the corporate sustainability framework, and by comparing them against four approaches to explain organisations. 

The paper proposes a definition and framework for more sustainable business models aimed at integrating organisational approaches, the company system, stakeholders, change and sustainability dimensions, thus providing a more holistic and systemic approach to discourses on sustainable business models.

#### Key-words
- corporate sustainability 
- business models
- sustainable business models
- organisational theory
- holism

#### First two sentences of the introduction
Companies have been considered as responsible for many negative impacts on the environment and on society[^1]. In response, corporations have engaged in efforts to integrate sustainability into their operations and better contribute to making societies more sustainable[^2], and satisfy the needs of today's societies without compromising the needs of tomorrow's[^3], that is, the time dimension. 

#### Last two sentences of the introduction
CS has recently been challenging traditional business models[^4][^5]. This has fostered a shift from selling products to providing service solutions to meet customer needs[^6][^7] and better engaging with stakeholders, while creating competitive advantages to customers, the company and society[^8][^9][^10]. A number of alternative, or sustainable, business models have been proposed to better contribute to sustainability (as proposed by [^11][^1][^7][^12][^10]).

# Article content
## Main concepts
#### Corporate sustainability
Corporate activities that proactively seek to contribute to sustainability equilibria, including the economic, environmental, and social dimensions of today, as well as their interrelations withing and throughout the time dimensions, while also adressing the company's system (including operations and production, management and strategy, organisational systems, procurement and marketing, governance and assessment, and communication) and its stakeholders.

## Supporting concept
#### More sustainable business model
A holistic and systemic reflection of how a company operationalises its strategy, based on resource efficiency (through operations and production, management and strategy, organisational systems, governance, assessment and reporting, and change), so the outputs have more value and contribute to sustainability more than the inputs (with regard to material and resources that are transformed into products and services, economic value, human resources, and environmental value). The business model is affected by the company's resources (tangible and intangible), the supply chain and the company's stakeholders (internal, interconnecting and external), including the environment (inside and outside the company).

#### Hermeneutics
Hermeneutics is a discipline that sets itself upon the task of specifying and justifying a methodology of interpretation, originally of texts, but by extension of many other interpretanda. It has also been called the science or art of interpretation. [Source.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/hermeneutics)

## Research aim(s)
This paper is aimed at providing a different perspective to SBMs by analysing current definitions against the corporate sustainability framework to assess the elements and activities covered and four approaches to explain organizations. 

## Methodology
Seven peer‐reviewed papers were selected that aimed at defining and explaining SBMs and have been widey cited. The publications are briefly presented, in chronological order. Each of the definitions was analysed using hermeneutics (see [^13][^14][^15]), which allows a researcher to understand and, ultimately, discriminate critically between blind and enabling prejudices[^16]. The analysis depends on the experience of the interpreter[^17]. In hermeneutics, the whole has to be understood from its individual elements and their connections with each other, while at the same time the individual elements create the whole[^17][^18][^13][^19].

The papers were analysed in two ways. Firstly, they were analyzed by assessing the elements and activities covered (as indicated by [^20]). This was done using the corporate sustainability framework (including the company system, sustainability's dimensions and stakeholders) as shown in Figure 1. Secondly, they were analysed by comparing the papers against [^21] four approaches to explain organizations, such as companies. These approaches are: 
1. external resource approach, which allows managers to evaluate how effectively an organisation manages and controls its external environment; 
2. internal systems approach, which allows managers to evaluate how effectively an organisation functions and operates; 
3. technical approach, which allows managers to evaluate how effectively an organization can convert some fixed amount of organisational skills and resources into finished goods and services;
4. inputs approach, which includes resources such as raw materials, machinery, information and knowledge, human resources, and money and capital. 

This allowed me to understand the position(s) taken by the definitions. The papers are summarised and then analysed.

## Summary of key points
- "Business model" and "strategy" are used interchangeably, but they are different. A business model describes the company systems and how its elements fit together, but it does not consider competition, as strategy[^25].
- Value, in this paper, is explained by four flows: 
  1. material resources and energy (as inputs) and products and services (as outputs); 
  2. economic value; 
  3. human resources; 
  4. environmental value. 
- Adding value is provided by the company system elements through change processes. The company must be seen as an entity that is affected by external resources, internal systems, technical issues and inputs.

- Need for strategic sustainability management.
  - It is not sufficient to add on sustainability programmes to current operations.
  - Sustainability has to become an essential element of organisations' strategies and values.
  - → Sustainability is a management task that has to be planned strategically for the whole organisational system.
- Business models (BMs).
  - Every organisation independent of its size or the sector it is operating in has a business model[^26].
  - A business model offers a comprehensive understanding of:
    - how a company does business[^27][^28], and 
    - how value is created[^29].
  - → Business models describe a company's core logic to create and capture value, its value proposition[^28].
  - → They can help to focus on how all the elements of the system fit together as a whole[^25].
  - A business model clarifies the chosen position of the company within the value chain, _i.e._ what are the key assets to own and control in order to capture value[^28].
  - A reflection of the company's strategy[^30].
  - → Has to be differentiated from a company's strategy:
    - _strategy_: defines the process on how to generate value and move to a desired future;
    - _business model_: describes that state[^31].
- Elements of business models:
  - Value proposition as the offer and the target customer segment, the value creation and delivery system, and the value capture system[^32][^8][^33].
  - Zott and Amit (2010) proposed an activity perspective on business models; the selection of activities (_i.e._ ‘what’), the activity system structure (_i.e._ ‘how’), and who performs the activities (_i.e._ ‘who’)[^34].
  - In general, business models should be seen through the lens of permanent interactions between these elements and activities, and the implications of their changes[^20].
  - This should support the understanding of how companies work and how they create value for different internal and external stakeholders[^35]. 
  - Since a company may have different value propositions, it may have other business models with their hierarchical relationships[^36] at different organisational levels[^37].
- Business models and stakeholders.
  - Traditional business models have been based on a clear distinction between the companies[^38].
  - However, the company is linked to several stakeholders generating a dependency relation: 
    - the external stakeholder demands are converted into the supplied characteristics constituting a product or service by the company having a considerable effect on the company’s business model[^39].
  - This view of a business model is seen as a means to reduce costs by contracting stakeholders[^40].
  - Such a business model, thus, focusses on explaining a firm’s operations in practice.
- Towards more sustainable business models.
  - Business models have been used to understand organisations and assess their activities since the late 1990s[^31].
  - Traditional business model research focus on maximisation of profits and take a single-actor perspective[^41][^28]. 
  - The increasing pressure for companies to prove their sustainability efforts has challenged traditional business models[^4][^41]. 
  - A number of alternative, or sustainable, business models have been proposed to better contribute to sustainability (see [^43][^7][^10][^11][^12]).
- Corporate sustainability and business models.
  - To move towards sustainability, a company has to transform its entire logic of how to do business[^44].
  - → Shift from selling products to providing service solutions to customer needs[^6][^7].
  - → Better engaging with stakeholders, while creating competitive advantages to customers, the company, and society[^8][^9][^10].
- Alternative business models.
  - More sustainable business models mainly focus on reducing the environmental burdens, with a particular focus toward switching from product sales to a service approach[^45][^7][^10].
  - Three alternative business models[^6]:
    - leasing - where the supplier becomes a service provider by retaining the ownership and assuming responsibility for maintenance, in this case the customer pays a regular fee for unlimited individual access to the product; 
    - renting - similar to leasing, however, the customer does not have unlimited access; 
    - 'product pooling' - where the equipment is used simultaneously by several users instead of a sequential mode of use.
- Sustainable business models examples.
  - Selling the function that baby prams provide[^7].
  - Chemical leasing, where chemical companies move from selling tons of chemicals to a service oriented business[^46][^47].

  - Ridesharing business models for sustainability[^48], such as carpooling, flexible carpooling, vanpooling, and ridesharing.
- Methods.
  - In the last lustrum, there has been a steady increase in publications using the term ‘sustainable business models’; however, there have been few that have theoretically defined or characterised the term, and in most cases, they just apply the term.
  - Seven peer-reviewed papers were selected since they are aimed at defining and explaining SBMs and have been cited considerably. 
  - Each of the definitions was analysed using hermeneutics (see [^13][^14][^15]).
- Analytical methods.
  - Firstly, by assessing the elements and activities covered (as indicated by [^20]).
    - This was done using the Corporate Sustainability framework (figure 1, including the company system, sustainability's dimensions, and stakeholders).
  - Secondly, by comparing the papers against Jones’s (2013)[^21] four approaches to explain organisations:
    - external resource approach - which allows managers to evaluate how effectively an organisation manages and controls its external environment;
    - internal systems approach - which allows managers to evaluate how effectively an organisation functions and operates; 
    - technical approach - which allows managers to evaluate how effectively an organisation can convert some fixed amount of organisational skills and resources into finished goods and services;
    - inputs approach - which includes resources such as raw materials, machinery, information and knowledge, human resources, and money and capital.
- Sustainable business models summary.
  - A sustainable business model uses a Triple Bottom Line Approach in measuring performance.
  - A sustainable business model considers the needs of all stakeholders rather than giving priority to shareholders' expectations.
  - A sustainable business model treats nature as a stakeholder and promotes environmental stewardship.
  - Sustainability leaders, or champions, drive the cultural and structural changes necessary to implement sustainability, and a sustainable business model encompasses the systems perspective, as well as the firm-level perspective[^10].
  - Four elements of a sustainable business model[^8]:
    - value proposition - providing measureable ecological and/or social value in concert with economic value;
    - supply chain - involving suppliers who take responsibility for their own as well as the focal company’s stakeholders;
    - customer interface - motivating customers to take responsibility for their consumption as well as for the focal company's stakeholders;
    - financial model - reflecting an appropriate distribution of economic costs and benefits among actors involved in the business model and accounting for the company’s ecological and social impacts.
  - Eight sustainable business model archetypes, grouping them into[^22]:
    - technological 
      - maximise material and energy efficiency, create value from 'waste', and substitute products and processes with renewable and natural ones;
    - social 
      - deliver functionality, instead of having ownership; adopt a stewardship role; and encourage sufficiency;
    - organisational 
      - repurpose the business for society and the environment, and develop scale-up solutions.
  - Business Models for Sustainability (BMfS) connects four partial models:
    - the firm
    - the environment
    - the decision maker
    - the customer
  - The business model for sustainability is built on the firm's 
    - value creation capacity, 
    - value to the customers, 
    - value to the natural environment, and 
      - the environment is conceptualised by means of three main stocks: renewable resources, non-renewable resources, as well as pollution and waste[^22].
    - the value that the firm captures.
  - New business models for sustainability are developed through interactions between individuals and groups inside and outside companies, which are based on three elements:
    - building networks and collaborative practices for learning and action around a new vision;
    - deploying new concepts drawn from outside the company;
    - elaborating and implementing structure within a reconfigured network[^24].
  - "_A business model for sustainability helps describing, analysing, managing, and communicating_ 
    1. _a company’s sustainable value proposition to its customers, and all other stakeholders,_ 
    2. _how it creates and delivers this value,_ 
    3. _and how it captures economic value while maintaining or regenerating natural, social, and economic capital beyond its organizational boundaries_"[^12].
  - Upward and Jones (2016) provided an ontological discussion to define sustainable business models and propose a framework[^23]. These are based on: 
    1. stakeholders considering human and non-human, 
    2. governance, 
    3. tools and framework to embed sustainability, 
    4. biomimicry frameworks, 
    5. industrial ecology principles.
  - The authors explicitly mention the time perspective in their arguments.
  - The authors propose the following components: 
    - actor; 
    - stakeholder; 
    - target customer; 
    - channel; 
    - value proposition; 
    - decision (governance); 
    - relationship; 
    - value configuration; 
    - partnership; 
    - capability; 
    - process measure (non-financial); 
    - profit; 
    - cost; 
    - revenue; 
    - assets.
- Critiques to current sustainable business model approaches.
  - Although some discussions on sustainable business models claim to be based on the triple bottom line[^21][^10], the majority of them are heavily focused on the environmental dimension, such as ecological modernisation or through resource efficiency (see [^21][^49][^50][^51][^10]).
  - Bocken et al. (2014) highlighted some social issues of sustainability, but these are mainly of the impacts of products for consumers[^21]. 
  - The time dimension is conspicuously missing in sustainable business models discourse.
  - Most definitions are based on a narrow, business oriented perspective of value proposition, creation, and delivery (see [^22][^21][^8][^12]) , with the exception of Upward and Jones[^23]. This arises from the traditional business model perspective, _i.e._ from a (mainly economic) value point of view.
  - Sustainability encompasses economic, environmental, social, and time dimensions, thus, a sustainable business model should be seen from a sustainability perspective on how to add value to the four dimensions of sustainability, and not from value focussed on how to increase sustainability performance.
  - Most authors use the term **sustainable business model**, with the exception of [^12], who prefer the term **business models for sustainability**.
  - Terminologically, it will be better to label this term as **sustainability oriented business models**, but this would imply that the view is from business models to sustainability.
  - A better term would be **more sustainable business models**, where sustainability is embedded in the business model, and is based on sustainability as a dynamic ideal, and thus no business model will ever be fully sustainable.
- Proposed definition of a **more sustainable business model**.
  - A holistic and systemic reflection of how a company operationalises its strategy, based on resource efficiency (through operations and production, management and strategy, organisational systems, governance, assessment and reporting, and change), so that the outputs have more value and contribute to sustainability more than the inputs (in regards to material and resources that are transformed into products and services, economic value, human resources, and environmental value).
  - The business model is affected by the company's resources (tangible and intangible), the supply chain, and the company's stakeholders (internal, inter-connecting, and external), including the environment (inside and outside the company).
  - [Figure 2](#figures).
- Conclusions.
  - The More Sustainable Business Models framework is aimed at integrating organisational approaches, the company system, stakeholders, change, and sustainability dimensions, thus, providing a more holistic and systemic approach to sustainable businesss model discourse.
  - The framework can also serve as a base for companies to analyse how CS has been integrated into their business models, strategies, and activities, and, consequently, contribute to making societies more sustainable.
  - Companies have to embed sustainability holistically, systemically, and integrally into the elements of their business models on cultural, structural, firm-level, and systems-level attributes to create value for the company whilst considering its stakeholders, and not based, as in many sustainable business model discourses, on creating value under the pretence of sustainability.
