#### Summary
The industrial park of Herdersbrug (Brugge, Flanders, Belgium) comprises 92 small and medium-sized enterprises, a waste-to-energy incinerator, and a power plant (not included in the study) on its site. To study the carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) neutrality of the park, we made a park-wide inventory for 2007 of the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions due to energy consumption (electricity and fossil fuel) and waste incineration, as well as an inventory of the existing renewable electricity and heat generation. 

The definition of CO<sub>2</sub> neutrality in Flanders only considers CO<sub>2</sub> released as a consequence of consumption or generation of electricity, not the CO<sub>2</sub> emitted when fossil fuel is consumed for heat generation. To further decrease or avoid CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, we project and evaluate measures to increase renewable energy generation.

The 21 kilotons (kt) of CO<sub>2</sub> emitted due to electricity consumption are more than compensated by the 25 kt of CO<sub>2</sub> avoided by generation of renewable electricity. Herdersbrug Industrial Park is thus CO<sub>2</sub> neutral, according to the definition of the Flemish government. 

Only a small fraction (6.6%) of the CO<sub>2</sub> emitted as a consequence of fossil fuel consumption (heat generation) and waste incineration is compensated by existing and projected measures for renewable heat generation. Of the total CO<sub>2</sub> emission (149 kt) due to energy consumption (electricity + heat generation) and waste incineration on the Herdersbrug Industrial Park in 2007, 70.5% is compensated by existing and projected renewable energy generated in the park. Forty-seven percent of the yearly avoided CO<sub>2</sub> corresponds to renewable energy generated from waste incineration and biomass fermentation.

#### Keywords
- carbon dioxide emissions
- cost-effectiveness
- eco-industrial park (EIP)
- energy consumption
- industrial ecology
- renewable energy

#### First two sentences of the introduction
The concept of sustainable development has become a guiding principle for governments, industries, and communities. For industrial activities, concepts such as pollution prevention (PP), cleaner production (CP), and industrial ecology (IE) promote innovative technologies and the shift from end-of-pipe techniques to pollution prevention at the source[^1][^2][^3][^4].

#### Last two sentences of the introduction
This study thus investigates the CO<sub>2</sub> neutrality of an industrial park in a broader sense than usual in Flanders. Introduction of renewable energy to an industrial park only makes sense after critical evaluation of the actual energy consumption and after implementation of energy-saving measures, such as relighting and insulation.

## Methodology
- Inventories of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions due to energy consumption (electricity and fossil fuel) and waste incineration and of the existing renewable energy (electricity and heat) generation were made for Herdersbrug Industrial Park for 2007
- Electricity and natural gas consumption data were provided by the distribution grid operator Eandis.
- Fuel oil consumption data were collected by means of an inquiry. 
  - For 15 companies out of the 92 that use fuel oil, consumption data were not available. For these companies, fuel oil consumption was estimated with a tool developed by Hens (2008). The validity of the estimates was checked through comparison of real consumption data with estimates for six other companies with similar energy use and known consumption of fossil fuel; the difference was only 6%.
  - To calculate CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and avoided CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, we used emission factors.
- We made an inventory of the renewable electricity and heat generation in the park in 2007, together with the corresponding avoided CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. 
  - The roof of two companies (16,000 square meters) was covered with photovoltaic panels, which generated yearly 1,300 MWh of renewable electricity (76.65 kWh/m<sup>2</sup>, given a roof inclination of 30° and with shading taken into account), which avoids the emission of 0.8 kt of CO<sub>2</sub>.
- We performed an economic study to estimate investment cost and payback time.
