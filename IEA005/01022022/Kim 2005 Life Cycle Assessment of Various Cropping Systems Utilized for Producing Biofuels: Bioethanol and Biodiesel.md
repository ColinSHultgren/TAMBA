#### Abstract
A life cycle assessment of different cropping systems emphasizing corn and soybean production was performed, assuming that biomass from the cropping systems is utilized for producing biofuels (_i.e._ ethanol and biodiesel). The functional unit is defined as 1 ha of arable land producing biomass for biofuels to compare the environmental performance of the different cropping systems. 

The external functions are allocated by introducing alternative product systems (the system expansion allocation approach). Nonrenewable energy consumption, global warming impact, acidification and eutrophication are considered as potential environmental impacts and estimated by characterization factors given by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA-TRACI). 

The benefits of corn stover removal are (1) lower nitrogen related environmental burdens from the soil, (2) higher ethanol production rate per unit arable land, and (3) energy recovery from lignin-rich fermentation residues, while the disadvantages of corn stover removal are a lower accumulation rate of soil organic carbon and higher fuel consumption in harvesting corn stover. Planting winter cover crops can compensate for some disadvantages (_i.e._ soil organic carbon levels and soil erosion) of removing corn stover. Cover crops also permit more corn stover to be harvested. 

Thus, utilisation of corn stover and winter cover crops can improve the eco-efficiency of the cropping systems. When biomass from the cropping systems is utilised for biofuel production, all the cropping systems studied here offer environmental benefits in terms of nonrenewable energy consumption and global warming impact. Therefore utilizing biomass for biofuels would save nonrenewable energy, and reduce greenhouse gases. 

However, unless additional measures such as planting cover crops were taken, utilization of biomass for biofuels would also tend to increase acidification and eutrophication, primarily because large nitrogen (and phosphorus)-related environmental burdens are released from the soil during cultivation.

#### First two sentences of the introduction
Ethanol derived from biomass has the potential to be a renewable transportation fuel that can replace gasoline. About 15 million m<sup>3</sup> of ethanol are produced annually in the United States, primarily from corn grain[^1].

#### Last two sentences of the introduction
Carbon contents in biomass, other coproducts and biofuels are not accounted for in this study. The 100-year time horizon global warming potentials[^2] are used to estimate global warming impact.

## Methodology
- They planted a corn-soybean rotation and three continuous corn cultivations, one of which with 50% residue removal rate and one with 70%. No-till agricultural practice is applied to all the scenarios.
- Soil organic carbon and soil nitrogen dynamics are estimated using a model.
- Functional unit: 1 hectare of arable land for a forty-year period.
- Made into biofuel.
- Four locations.

## Results
- Cropping system.
  - Table 4: cradle-to-gate values.
  - The corn–soybean rotation (CS) has a lower global warming impact than continuous corn culture (CC) due to lower agronomic inputs and less fuel consumption.
  - The CC50 cropping system has the highest global warming impact because of high fuel consumption and low carbon credits due to changes in soil organic carbon levels. 
- Final products.
  - Biodiesel from the CS cropping system enables a B20-fueled urban bus to drive 75,000km.
  - Ethanol produced in each cropping system, which is used as an E10 fuel, can drive a compact passenger vehicle up to 6.7 million km in CS, 13.6 million km in CC, 19.0 million km in CC50, and 22.4 million km in CwC70. 
  - To compare the environmental performance of each cropping system, the environmental burdens associated with the overall systems are allocated by the system expansion approach (see Fig. 2).
- Overall system.
  - The CS cropping system has a smaller energy credit because the quantity of ethanol produced in this cropping system is smaller than other cropping systems and the biodiesel produced does not make up the difference. 
  - All the cropping systems have negative greenhouse gas emissions (global warming credit), indicating that the cropping systems considered here reduce greenhouse gas emissions when biomass is utilized for producing biofuels.
  - The corn–soybean rotation system has the lowest global warming credit because of a lower ethanol production rate.
  - The environmental burdens contributing most to eutrophication are emissions related to nitrogen and phosphorus. 
  - The lowest acidification rate occurs in the CS cropping system followed by the CC cropping system. The CS cropping system has the lowest NO<sub>x</sub> emissions associated with soil nitrogen fluxes among the cropping systems considered here.
  - The corn–soybean rotation system (CS) has a better eutrophication profile than the CC cropping system due to lower eutrophication in the agricultural process. This improved profile occurs even though the avoided impact associated with the driving process by a gasoline-fueled vehicle in the CS cropping system is much less than in the CC cropping system.
- Sensitivity analysis.
  - Reductions in eutrophication with respect to increased electricity generation efficiency are not significant compared to other impacts. 
- Comparison.
  - Eco-efficiency used in this study is calculated by dividing the ratio of product value to operating cost by the environmental impact ratio.
  - The ratio of product value to operating cost is defined as a ratio of the market value of biofuels (_i.e._ ethanol and biodiesel) and coproducts (_e.g._ CGM, electricity, steam, etc.) to the cost of raw materials and fuel (_e.g._ corn grain, corn stover, coal, crude oil, natural gas, etc.) used in the process operations. Thus a practice with a greater eco-efficiency would be more sustainable—_i.e._ it would provide more economic value per unit of environmental impact. Since the eco-efficiency is dimensionless, it is possible to sum up the eco-efficiency of each impact category if all the impact categories are appropriately weighted. 

## Summary of key points
From the results of these simulations, it appears that corn stover removal from the no-tillage production system lowers the accumulation rate of soil organic carbon and consumes more energy. These simulation results for soil organic carbon and nitrogen dynamics should be confirmed field investigations before large-scale implementation. 

The merits of corn stover removal are: 
1. lower nitrogen related burdens from the soil, 
2. higher ethanol production rate per unit arable land, and 
3. energy recovery from lignin-rich fermentation residues. 

Winter cover crop cultivation can compensate for some disadvantages (_i.e._ soil organic carbon levels and soil erosion) of removing corn stover, and also permits more corn stover to be harvested. Thus, utiliaation of corn stover and winter cover crops can improve the ecoefficiency of the cropping systems.

When biomass from the cropping systems studied here is utilized for biofuel production (_e.g._ ethanol and biodiesel), all the cropping systems studied have negative environmental impacts (credits) in terms of nonrenewable energy consumption and global warming impact. Thus utilising biomass for biofuels would save nonrenewable energy and reduce greenhouse gases.

However, the utilisation of biomass for biofuels would increase acidification and eutrophication particularly because of nitrogen (and phosphorus) related burdens from the soil during cultivation. Thus other approaches to reduce these burdens in the agricultural process (_e.g._ use of buffer strips, etc.) are necessary to achieve better profiles for acidification and eutrophication associated with the cropping systems. Corn stover pretreatment by sulfuric acid significantly adds to these two environmental impacts. Alternative pretreatments may prove less environmental damaging.
