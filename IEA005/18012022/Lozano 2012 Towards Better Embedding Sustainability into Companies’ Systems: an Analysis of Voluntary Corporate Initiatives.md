#### Abstract
Corporate leaders and employees have been increasingly recognising their role in contributing to sustainability. In this context, different voluntary tools, approaches, and initiatives have been developed by and for corporations to engage with sustainability. However, there has been a lack of clarity in explaining how the initiatives address the different elements of the company system (operations and processes, management and strategy, organisational systems, procurement and marketing, and assessment and communication), how they contribute to sustainability’s dimensions (economic, environmental, social, and time), how they are linked, or combined to help leaders better embed sustainability into their company’s system. 

The paper provides an analysis of sixteen of the most widely used initiatives (_e.g._ life cycle assessment, eco-design, cleaner production, corporate social responsibility, and sustainability reporting). Each initiative was analysed on how it contributes or addresses the four dimensions of sustainability, and the company system. 

It was found that each initiative has advantages with respect to scope and focus for the sustainability dimensions and the company system’s elements, but it has certain disadvantages when it comes to dealing with the complexity and broadness of sustainability. The paper discusses how relying on one initiative can result in a limited and narrow contribution to sustainability and curtail coverage of the company’s system. The results indicate that the least addressed elements of the company system have been organisational systems and procurement and marketing. 

A new framework, the Corporate Integration of Voluntary Initiatives for Sustainability (CIVIS), is proposed with two purposes: (1) to help company leaders better understand how to improve their company’s contribution to sustainability, and (2) to foster a holistic approach through the combination of company initiatives that would help to embed sustainability into a company’s system with the least effort and maximum results.

#### First two sentences of the introduction
During the last fifteen years corporations, especially large ones, have become a key focus of attention in the sustainability debate, since they are perceived to be responsible for many negative impacts on the environment and on societies. In response to this, corporate leaders and employees have begun to recognise the relations and interdependences of the economic, environmental and social dimensions, for satisfying the needs of today’s societies without compromising the needs of tomorrow’s societies.

#### Last two sentences of the introduction
The discussion on the company system and sustainability serves as the basis for the analysis of the tools. This is aimed at helping company leaders, champions, and decision-makers to reduce confusion with regard to corporate sustainability initiatives by (1) improving the understanding and contribution of different voluntary initiatives to the company system and sustainability dimensions, and (2) fostering a holistic approach through the combination of company initiatives that would help to embed sustainability into the company with the least effort and maximum results.

## Research aim(s)
The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of each [voluntary initiative contributions to sustainability], and to facilitate its understanding and subsequent analysis.

## Methodology
Sixteen initiatives were selected from twenty-two corporate sustainability initiatives. The selection criteria were: having more than 5000 hits on Google Scholar (see Table 1), and, having been developed in or before 2001 (thus providing time for the initiative to be implemented and mature). The initiatives belong to Robèrt et al.’s (2002)[^1] ‘Follow up/Tools’ level, which is aimed at measuring, managing, and monitoring activities.

The initiatives were studied under the critical realism paradigm, where the experiences from sensations or images of the real world are processed through mental models, not the things directly[^2][^3], and the holistic perspective[^4]. The initiatives were analysed using Grounded Theory’s (GT) constant comparative analysis[^5], which offers the
potential to generate theory by explicitly coded and analytic procedures that help to identify, develop, and relate the concepts that make the building blocks of theory more systematic and creative[^6].

This paper uses the principles of mathematical combinatory group theory to propose the Corporate Integration of Voluntary Initiatives for Sustainability (CIVIS) framework.

### Stages of the comparative method
The constant comparative method has four stages. Firstly, comparing incidents applicable to each category, _i.e._ classifying the data into meaningful categories that may be derived from the data, from the theoretical framework, or from the researchers’ reading, life experiences, research, and scholarship. The categories used at the outset were taken from: 
1.  the two tiered sustainability equilibria's four dimensions of sustainability (economic, environmental, social, and the time); and
    - For the first set, the initiative analysed had to be explicit when addressing or having positive benefits with respect to the aforementioned issues in each dimension. For example, for the economic dimension, the indicators were market presence, customers, or acquisitions; an example of the environmental dimension would be reductions in the use of artificial chemical compounds, and energy usage, or an improvement in efficiency.
2.  the corporate system elements (operations, management, organisation, procurement and marketing, and assessment and communication). 
    - For the second set, the initiative had to address the aforementioned elements of the company system, which include technologies or materials for operations and production, culture or leadership for organisational systems, and reporting or accountability for assessment and communication. 

The coding was done from the definition of each initiative and from key papers that relied on or discussed it. For example, consider the statement: “_CP is the continuous use of
integrated preventive strategies to process products and services, utilising raw materials, e.g. energy and water, efficiently to reduce waste at source, and minimising risks to the environment and society_”[^7][^1][^8][^9]. In general, CP focuses on achieving environmental improvement in processes and product development[^10][^11]. This was coded as part of **Operations and production** (since it refers to processes and products) within the company system; and to the **Environment** and the **Economic** dimensions (since these aim to reduce environmental impacts which, usually, result in improvements to production efficiency); see Cleaner Production (CP) section for more details.

Secondly, integrating categories and their properties. The initiatives have been limited in capturing the full spectrum of sustainability and its implications of and for corporations (which concurs with [^12]).

Thirdly, helping to distinguish which elements had been addressed, and how the initiatives could complement each other to deal more holistically with the company system and the four dimensions of sustainability. This helped to address the point that the initiatives have been poorly linked[^13][^14].

Finally, writing the new or modified theory (or framework), which can then be used to develop or test hypotheses[^15][^6][^16] (Strauss and Corbin, 1998). In the case of this paper, it helped to develop the Corporate Integration of Voluntary Initiatives for Sustainability (CIVIS) framework
