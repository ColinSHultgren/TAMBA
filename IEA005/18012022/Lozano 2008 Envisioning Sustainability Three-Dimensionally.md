#### Abstract
Sustainability has arisen as an alternative to the dominant socio-economic paradigm (DSP). However, it is still a difficult concept for many to fully understand. To help to communicate it and make it more tangible visual representations have been used. Three of the most used, and critiqued, sustainability representations are:
1. a Venn diagram, *i.e.* three circles that inter-connect, where the resulting overlap that represents sustainability can be misleading; 
2. three concentric circles, the inner circle representing economic aspects, the middle social aspects, and the outer environmental aspects; and 
3. the Planning Hexagon, showing the relationships among economy, environment, the individual, group norms, technical skills, and legal and planning systems. 

Each has been useful in helping to engage the general public and raising sustainability awareness. However, they all suffer from being highly anthropocentric, compartmentalised, and lacking completeness and continuity. These drawbacks have reduced their acceptance and use by more advanced sustainability scholars, researchers and practitioners. This paper presents an innovative attempt to represent sustainability in three dimensions which show the complex and dynamic equilibria among economic, environmental and social aspects, and the short-, long- and longer-term perspectives.

#### Key-words
- sustainable development
- sustainability
- graphical representations
- Venn diagram
- concentric circles

#### First two sentences of the introduction
During the last 30 years, there have been unprecedented advances in development and industrialisation, with results such as increase of up to 20 years in life expectancy in developing countries, infant mortality rates have halved, literacy rates have risen, food production and consumption have increased faster than population rates, incomes have improved, and there has been a spread in democratically elected governments. However, it is increasingly recognised that such activities have been detrimental to economic, environmental, and social aspects. 

#### Last two sentences of the introduction
Although it is common to find the terms Sustainable Development and Sustainability used interchangeably, they are inherently different. Reid, Lozano-Ros, and Martin state that the difference lies in SD being the journey, path or process to achieve sustainability, *i.e.* the "capacity for continuance into the long-term future"’ or the ideal dynamic state.

# Article content
## Main concepts
##### Sustainable development
[D]evelopment that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. (Brundtland, 1987)

## Supporting concepts
##### Sustainability drivers/aspects
"the social, environmental, and economic aspects"

## Summary of key points
Oft-used depictions of sustainability and sustainable development are too simple. Lozano (2008) Proposes the two-tiered sustainability equilibria (TTSE) model. This depicts interactions between the first tier sustainability equilibrium (economic, environmental, and social aspects of sustainability) and the second tier sustainability equilibrium (short-, long- and longer terms).

## Abbreviations
|abr|abbreviation|
|---|------------|
|DSP|dominant socio-economic paradigm|
|FTSE|first tier sustainability equilibrium|
|SD|sustainable development|
|TNS|the natural step|
|TTSE|two-tiered sustainability equilibria|

# Context
In the then-contemporary quest to depict sustainability and sustainable development, this article deals with the contemporary sustainability models. That is before regenerative sustainability, but it does go for a doughnut-shape, mirroring doughnut economy.

## Significance
Useful for depiction discourse.

# Lecture comments
- Sustainability
  - During the last four decades, there have been a number of efforts aimed at addressing **economic disparity**, **environmental degradation**, and **social inequalities**, evolving from the 'Environmental Revolution' to Sustainable Development (SD).
  - Sustainability is aimed at addressing the negative economic, environmental, and social impacts in this generation and future ones.
- Sustainable development or sustainability?
  - Sustainable development and sustainability tend to be used **interchangeably**, but they are inherently **different**.
  - Sustainable development is the means to achieving sustainability, an ideal dynamic state, *i.e.* the path or process for getting there.
  - Sustainability is better understood as a **dynamic goal**, which needs to be continually re-assessed.
- Sustainability perspectives
  - Conventional economists' perspective.
    - Sustainability suggests a steady state.
    - Sustainability is confused with economic **viability**, *i.e.* sustained growth and self-sufficiency.
    - It attempts to simplify into economic terms natural and social phenomena.
    - Such perspective has very limited scope, **neglecting** the impacts of economic activities upon the **environment** and **societies** of today, and certainly in the future.
  - Non-environmental degradation perspective.
    - Represented by **environmental economics**.
    - Resources are **scarce**, consumption cannot be continued indefinitely, natural resources should be used without surpassing their carrying capacities, and environmental capital should not be depleted.
    - Sustainable development has primarily **environmental** connotations.
    - It tends to **neglect** the importance of social aspects. 
    - This perspective also fails to address the interrelations among the aspects.
  - Integrational perspective.
    - The key characteristic is the **integration** of economic, environmental, and social aspects, and their relations.
    - There are many overlaps among the aspects, but they are **not necessarily balanced**.
    - This perspective is, comparatively, more complete than the previous two. Nevertheless, it **lacks continuity**, the interactions among the short-, long-, and longer-term, focusing mainly on current activities.
  - Intergenerational perspective.
    - Main focus is on the **time perspective**, *e.g.* the Brundtland Report definition.
    - Although this perspective’s forte is its focus on continuity, in some cases it **does not explicitly** integrate the other aspects. 
    - Sometimes this perspective is critiqued as being too **broad and vague**, and **difficult** to ground in practical activities.
  - Holistic perspective.
    - Explicitly **combines** the integrational and inter-generational perspectives.
    - This perspective proposes two dynamic and simultaneous equilibria:
      - the first one amongst **economic**, **environmental**, and **social dimensions**, and
      - the second amongst the **temporal aspects**, *i.e.* short-, longand longer-term perspectives.

# Questions
## Before reading
- How does the "*innovative attempt to represent sustainability in three dimensions which show the complex and dynamic equilibria among economic, environmental and social aspects, and the short-, long- and longer-term perspectives*" stand up to time?

## During reading
- From this text, I understand the _"quest for sustainability"_ to consists of two steps (equalising sustainability aspects/drivers, and interrelating FTSE in dynamic change processes through time)?

## After reading
- How has this held up since 2008?
