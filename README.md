# Instructions - sort of
I mean, it's an iterative process, obviously.

I suggest using the [template](https://github.com/GreenVeggi/TAMBA/blob/main/template%20literature) to make notes on the reading materials.
We now have two folder for the concomitant courses. I've started putting the reading materials in a folder per lecture. For one of the courses, I used dates and the other course title - so that's nice and consistent.

For [Methods of Environmental Assessment](https://github.com/GreenVeggi/TAMBA/tree/main/MIA301) it might make more sense to not do it on a text-by-text basis. Rather, an overview per method might work better. 

Structure and stuff doesn't really matter. I'll probably be happy with any contribution.

## Adding text to an existing file
- Locate and open the file.
  - You can do this by clicking on the folder it's in and continuing until you've arrived at the file.
  - Alternatively, there is a sort of overview in the course folder, you can also click on the title of the text you want to contribute to and it'll take you there.
- Click on the pencil in the right-hand corner.

- You can now start typing.

## Adding a file
- Navigate to the folder you want to put the file in and click "Add file" in the right-hand corner.
- You can then choose from "create a new file" and "upload".

## Adding a file in a new folder
- You can place a file in a folder that doesn't yet exist using forward slashes.
- For example Lozano (2088):
  - TAMBA/IEA005/25012022/Lozano 2008 ...
