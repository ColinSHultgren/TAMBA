# Instructions - sort of
I mean, it's an iterative process, obviously.

I suggest using the [template](https://github.com/GreenVeggi/TAMBA/blob/main/template%20literature) to make notes on the reading materials.
We now have two folder for the concomitant courses. I've started putting the reading materials in a folder per lecture. For one of the courses, I used dates and the other course title - so that's nice and consistent.

For [Methods of Environmental Assessment](https://github.com/GreenVeggi/TAMBA/tree/main/MIA301) it might make more sense to not do it on a text-by-text basis. Rather, an overview per method might work better.
